# NureAlarm

## Short description
Application to simplify life. If you are as lucky as me (studying in **Nure**), then the alarm clock will set the time for the next lesson by itself.

## Application Features
* Automatic setting of an alarm for the next lesson (**Only Nure!**);
* Alarm clock notifications;
* Possibility to select the application language (English and Ukrainian);
* Ability to choose the time of daily alarm setting;
* Ability to select any available group;
* Excluding subjects - subjects that do not need to set an alarm;
* Activation selection (5 activation options before the lesson);
* Possibility to set an alarm clock manually both for the next lesson of the current day and for the first lesson of tomorrow;
* Ability to change the lesson or remove the alarm in the notification and in a specific part of the application;
* The ability to easily turn off the alarm even when the screen is off/locked.

## Note
If your phone forcibly puts the application to sleep, or kills the process altogether - try to give the application unlimited background work in the settings, or block the ability to put this application to sleep.
